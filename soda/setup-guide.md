Guide to right fit installation model for them;

include diagrams

Help them with example use cases to decide which model
Matrix this info somehow
* data migration
* data testing in development
* data testing in a pipeline for circuit breaking
* self-serve analytics, or for governance like for a data steward
* data as a product (like HF)
* starting from scratch, need data profiling and monitoring

Reference use case setuo guides

why do I need Soda Cloud?
    <details>
        <summary style="color:#00BC7E">Why do I need a Soda Cloud account?</summary>
    To validate your account license or free trial, the Soda Library Docker image that the GitHub Action uses to execute scans must communicate with a Soda Cloud account via API keys. <br />Create <a href="https://go.soda.io/api-keys" target="_blank">new API keys</a> in your Soda Cloud account, then use them to configure the connection between the Soda Library Docker image and your account in step 4 of this procedure. <br /><br />
    </details>

Options:
* set up SSO
* use a a PrivateLink
* invite others, and why
* reporting API
