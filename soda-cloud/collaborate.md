# Organize results, set alerts, investigate issues
*Last modified on {% last_modified_at %}*

One of the main benefits of using Soda Cloud is the ability to collaborate with your teammates on the work to monitor and maintain data quality. Including multiple perspectives yields a more robust interpretation of "good quality data".

As the last step in the **Get started roadmap**, this guide offers instructions to organize your check results, customize alert notifications, and open incidents to investigate issues.

## Integrate with Slack

{% include integrate-slack-steps.md %}

## Invite your team members

Invite the members of your team to join you in your work to monitor data quality in your organization.

In Soda Cloud, navigate to **your avatar** > **Invite Team Members** and fill in the blanks.

When your team members receive the invitation email, they can click the link in the email to create their own login credentials to access your Soda Cloud account directly. Refer to [Default roles and groups]({% link soda-cloud/roles-and-rights.md %}#default-roles-and-groups) to learn more about the default access rights Soda Cloud assigns to new users.

Note that if your organization uses a single sign-on (SSO) identity provider to access Soda Cloud, you cannot invite team members in Soda Cloud. Instead, contact your IT Admin to request access to Soda Cloud using your SSO. See also, [Single Sign-on with Soda Cloud]({% link soda-cloud/sso.md %}).

## Share test results and filtered views

Collaborating as a team on Soda Cloud means you can quickly share the lastest test results for a dataset with others.

1. In Soda Cloud, navigate to the **Datasets** dashboard, then select the dataset you wish to share.
2. Copy the URL of the dataset, then paste it into a message to the teammates who have access to your organization's Soda Cloud account.

## Create and manage Incidents

[Create an Incident]({% link soda-cloud/incidents.md %}) in Soda Cloud to track your team's investgation and resolution of the data quality issue. 

If you have integrated your Soda Cloud account with a Slack workspace, you can use an Incident's built-in ability to create an incident-specific Slack channel where you and your team can collaborate on the issue investigation.

## Go further

* Create a new [agreement]({% link soda-cloud/agreements.md %}) to establish an agreed-upon expectation of good-quality data.
* [Organize your datasets]({% link soda-cloud/organize-datasets.md %}) in Soda Cloud to facilitate your search for the right data.
* Set [notification rules]({% link soda-cloud/notif-rules.md %}) that apply to multiple checks in your account.
